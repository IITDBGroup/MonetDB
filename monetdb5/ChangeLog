# ChangeLog file for MonetDB5

- The mtime module was completely rewritten, the atom types date,
  daytime, and timestamp were changed.  Upgrade code for BATs
  containing these types has been implemented.  The old daytime type
  used a 32 bit integer to record milliseconds since the start of the
  day.  The new daytime type uses a 64 bit integer to record
  microseconds since the start of the day.  The old date type recorded
  days since or before the year 1.  The new daytime type records the
  day of the month and the number of months since the year -4712
  separately in a single 32 bit integer of which only 26 bits are
  used.  Dates now use the proleptic Gregorian calendar, meaning the
  normal Gregorian callendar has been extended backward, and before
  the year 1, we have the year 0.  Both the old and new timestamp
  types are a combination of a daytime and a date value, but since
  those types have changed, the timestamp type has also changed.  The
  new date type has a smaller range than the old.  The new date range
  is from the year -4712 to the year 170049.  During conversion of
  date and timestamp columns, the dates are clamped to this range.
- The tzone and rule atom types have been removed.  They were not used
  by any code, and they were defined in a non-portable way.

- Added "mapi_ipv6" property to monet_options to force ipv6 address
  binding only.  This property is inherited while forking from
  monetdbd if it is also set there.

- Removed (bat)calc.between_symmetric and changed (bat)calc.between
  by adding a number of extra arguments, all of type :bit: symmetric,
  low inclusive, high inclusive, nils false.
