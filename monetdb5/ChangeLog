# ChangeLog file for MonetDB5
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Thu May  2 2019 Pedro Ferreira <pedro.ferreira@monetdbsolutions.com>
- Added "mapi_ipv6" property to monet_options to force ipv6 address
  binding only.  This property is inherited while forking from
  monetdbd if it is also set there.

* Thu Apr 18 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- Removed (bat)calc.between_symmetric and changed (bat)calc.between
  by adding a number of extra arguments, all of type :bit: symmetric,
  low inclusive, high inclusive, nils false.
- The layout of the bits in the tzone and rule atoms was changed.
  Before they were bitfields for which the C language does not give a
  guarantee (except that they are packed); now they are explicitly masked
  and shifted.  These types are not used by the SQL layer and therefore
  unlikely to be in any database.  No upgrade code has been created.
