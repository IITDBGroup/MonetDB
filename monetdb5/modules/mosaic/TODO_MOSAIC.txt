####technical depth####
Add asserts for unknown compression strategies.
Test null semantics
mosaic.select (c,nil:any_1, nil:any_1,true,true,(true|false)) is not working correctly: should result in c == nil or c!=nil(anti).
dictionary encoding should use the ordered property of its dictionary in the algebraic operators
Use bit vectors more aggressively in mosaic_delta --- then resolve test mosaic_delta_timestamp --- and possibly other compression techniques as well.
Somehow force mosaic to only use specified compressions even if inefficient. This poses a design problem for dictionary compression though.
Add test for float/double
delta compression: check if the hardcoded compression expression are correct. See also (2)
Add asserts on type degeneration for bit => bte daytime => lng timestmap => lng date => int.
Remove task-factor and range->factor or refactor them.
See if we can re-introduce landmark stuff somehow.
Fix/check/test MOSlayout.

####code issues####
mosaic_prefix.c: prefix code does not use macro's!!!!
mosaic_delta.c: improve the macro's: for instance get rid of hardcoded expression arguments in DELTAcompress. (2*)
mosaic_<compression>.c: for type macro's use macro-wised inline functions.
Improve the administration of the various hard coded compression techniques.
