####technical depth####
Test null semantics
mosaic.select (c,nil:any_1, nil:any_1,true,true,(true|false)) is not working correctly: should result in c == nil or c!=nil(anti).
Add test for float/double
Add test for bit
Remove task-factor and range->factor or refactor them.
Somehow log/print which compression is being used.
delta compression: check if the hardcoded compression expression are correct. See also (2)
Use bit vectors more aggressively in mosaic_delta --- then resolve test mosaic_delta_timestamp --- and possibly other compression techniques as well.
dictionary encoding should use the ordered property of its dictionary in the algebraic operators
See if we can re-introduce landmark stuff somehow.
Add asserts on type degeneration for bit => bte daytime => lng timestmap => lng date => int.

####code issues####
mosaic_prefix.c: prefix code does not use macro's!!!!
mosaic_delta.c: improve the macro's: for instance get rid of hardcoded expression arguments in DELTAcompress. (2)
mosaic_<compression>.c: for type macro's use macro-wised inline functions.
