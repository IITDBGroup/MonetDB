####technical depth####
Make dictionary variable-sized so it can always compress. We are going to use vheap for this.
dictionary encoding should use the ordered property of its dictionary in the algebraic operators
decouple estimation completely from compression: there should be two runs: one for estimating the blocks and one to actual compress according to the estimations.
Test null semantics
mosaic.select (c,nil:any_1, nil:any_1,true,true,(true|false)) is not working correctly: should result in c == nil or c!=nil(anti).
Use bit vectors more aggressively in mosaic_delta --- then resolve test mosaic_delta_timestamp --- and possibly other compression techniques as well.
Somehow force mosaic to only use specified compressions even if inefficient. This poses a design problem for dictionary compression though.
fix layout call.
Add test for float/double
delta compression: check if the hardcoded compression expression are correct. See also (2)
Add asserts on type degeneration for bit => bte daytime => lng timestmap => lng date => int.
Fix the task-factor array.
See if we can re-introduce landmark stuff somehow.
Fix/check/test MOSlayout.

####code issues####
move mask, bits, framebits from  MosaicHdr to MosaicBlkHeader_frame_t.
mosaic_prefix.c: prefix code does not use macro's!!!!
mosaic_delta.c: improve the macro's: for instance get rid of hardcoded expression arguments in DELTAcompress. (2*)
mosaic_<compression>.c: for type macro's use macro-wised inline functions.
Improve the administration of the various hard coded compression techniques. (2*)
