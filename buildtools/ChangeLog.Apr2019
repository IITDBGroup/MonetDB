# ChangeLog file for buildtools
# This file is updated with Maddlog

* Tue Mar 19 2019 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- We now use the C11 atomic operations if available, although
  libatomic_ops is still used if present and not disabled on the configure
  command line.

* Wed Aug 29 2018 Sjoerd Mullender <sjoerd@acm.org>
- We now also build the Python 3 integration packages for Fedora, Debian,
  Ubuntu, and Windows (not for Debian 8, Ubuntu 14.04, or EPEL 6 and 7
  which are too old).
