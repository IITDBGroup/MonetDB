- The sql SAMPLE syntax is extended to include an optional integral SEED
  parameter that sets the seed for the internal random number generator
  in the sample algorithm.  When the seed is set, the user can obtain
  a reproducible sample set from a static dataset with the same sample
  query. The new syntax is
  SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... SAMPLE <expr> [SEED <integer>]

- Implemented a version of COPY INTO that reads/writes files from/to
  the client instead of doing it in the server.  This has the
  advantage that COPY INTO is then no longer restricted to only the
  "super user" monetdb, nor only to absolute file names.  The syntax
  to have the server communicate with the client for file content is
  COPY INTO table FROM file ON CLIENT ...; and COPY query INTO file ON
  CLIENT ...;.  This also works for COPY BINARY INTO.  There is also
  the possibility to specify that files are to be read/written by the
  server by using ON SERVER.  This is also the default when ON CLIENT
  or ON SERVER is not specified.

- The sys.functions table now has an extra column called "system" of
  type BOOLEAN whose value is TRUE for system functions (i.e. functions
  that should not be dumped).  The table sys.systemfunctions has been
  changed to a view and is now officially deprecated.

- Extended merge tables with partitioning using a predicate:
  > CREATE MERGE TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] table_name (... columns ...)
  [ PARTITION BY { RANGE | VALUES }
  { ON '(' column_name ')' | USING '(' expression ')' } ]
  The partitioning can occur by range or list of values using one of
  the table's columns or an expression. The domain of the partitioning
  scheme will be covered by each child table added with alter statements
  depending if the table is partitioned by range or list of values:
  > ALTER TABLE merge_table_name { ADD | SET } TABLE child_table_name
  AS PARTITION IN '(' expression [ ',' ... ] ')' [ WITH NULL ]
  > ALTER TABLE merge_table_name { ADD | SET } TABLE child_table_name
  AS PARTITION BETWEEN { RANGE MINVALUE | expression } AND
  { RANGE MAXVALUE | expression } [ WITH NULL ]
  > ALTER TABLE merge_table_name { ADD | SET } TABLE child_table_name
  AS PARTITION WITH NULL
  When updating a single partition range/list of values, the SET
  keyword should be used instead of ADD.
  INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements are possible on partitioned
  tables with corresponding validation on each partition domain.
  The system tables sys.table_partitions, sys.range_partitions and
  sys.value_partitions were added to store meta-information about
  each existing partition.
