- Added "VALUES row_list" statement as a top SQL projection statement.

* Mon Feb 18 2019 Aris Koning <aris.koning@monetdbsolutions.com>
- The implementation of in-expression now follows a join-based approach
  instead of using iterative union/selects. This greatly improves
  performance for large in-value-lists. Furthermore the old approach has
  large in-value-lists generate large MAL plans. This is now no longer
  the case.
